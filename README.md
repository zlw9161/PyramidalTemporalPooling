### Abstract
An audio representation learning method with a hierarchical pyramid structure called pyramidal temporal pooling (PTP) which aims to capture the temporal information of an entire audio sample. By stacking a global temporal pooling layer on multiple local temporal pooling layers, the PTP can capture the high-level temporal dynamics of the input feature sequence in an unsuper-vised way.
